=head1 NAME

RedisDB - Perl extension to access redis database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RedisDB;

    my $redis = RedisDB->new(host => 'localhost', port => 6379);
    $redis->set($key, $value);
    my $value = $redis->get($key);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides interface to access redis database. It transparently
handles disconnects and forks. It supports pipelining mode.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $class->new(%options)

Creates new RedisDB object. The following options are allowed:

=over 4

=item host

domain name of the host running redis server. Default: "localhost"

=item port

port to connect. Default: 6379

=item path

you can connect to redis using UNIX socket. In this case instead of
I<host> and I<port> you should specify I<path>.

=item timeout

IO timeout. With this option set, if IO operation will take more than specified
number of seconds module will croak. Note, that some OSes don't support SO_RCVTIMEO,
and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options, in this case timeout will not work.

=item lazy

by default I<new> establishes connection to the server. If this parameter is
set, then connection will be established when you will send command to the
server.

=back

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = ref $_[0] ? $_[0] : {@_};
    bless $self, $class;
    if ( $self->{path} and ( $self->{host} or $self->{port} ) ) {
        croak "You can't specify \"path\" together with \"host\" and \"port\"";
    }
    $self->{port} ||= 6379;
    $self->{host} ||= 'localhost';
    $self->{_replies} = [];
    $self->{_callbacks} = [];
    $self->_connect unless $self->{lazy};
    return $self;
}

=head2 $self->execute($command, @arguments)

send command to the server and return server reply. It throws exception if
server returns error. It may be more convenient to use instead of this method
wrapper named after the redis command. E.g.:

    $redis->execute('set', key => 'value');
    # is the same as
    $redis->set(key => 'value');

See "SUPPORTED REDIS COMMANDS" section for the full list of defined aliases.

Note, that you can't use I<execute> if you have sent some commands in pipelining
mode and haven't yet got all replies.

send command to the server, invoke specified I<callback> on reply. Callback
invoked with 2 arguments: RedisDB object, and reply from the server.  If server
return error reply will be L<RedisDB::Error> object, you can get description of
error using this object in string context.  If I<callback> is not specified
reply will be discarded.  Note, that RedisDB doesn't run any background
threads, so it will not receive reply and invoke callback unless you call some

See description of all commands in redis documentation at L<http://redis.io/commands>.

=cut

for my $command (@commands) {
    my $uccom = uc $command;
    $uccom =~ s/_/ /g;
    no strict 'refs';
    *{ __PACKAGE__ . "::$command" } = sub {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->execute( $uccom, @_ );
    };
}

=pod

The following commands implement some additional postprocessing of results:

=cut

=head2 $self->info

Return information and statistics about server. Redis returns information in form of
I<field:value>, I<info> method parses result and returns it as hash reference.

=cut

sub info {
    my $self = shift;

    my $info = $self->execute('INFO');
    my %info = map { /^([^:]+):(.*)$/ } split /\r\n/, $info;
    return \%info;
}

=head2 $self->shutdown

Shuts redis server down. Returns undef, as server doesn't send answer.
Croaks in case of error.

=cut

sub shutdown {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->send_command('SHUTDOWN');
    pop @{ $self->{_callbacks} };
    return;
}

=head1 HANDLING OF SERVER DISCONNECTS

Redis server may close connection if it was idle for some time, also connection
may be closed in case redis-server was restarted. RedisDB restores connection
to the server but only if no data was lost as result of disconnect. E.g. if
client was idle for some time and redis server closed connection, it will be
transparently restored on sending next command. If you send a command and
server closed connection without sending complete reply, connection will not be
restored and module will throw exception. Also module will throw exception if
connection will be closed in the middle of transaction or while you're in
subscription loop.

=cut

=head1 PIPELINING SUPPORT

You can send commands in pipelining mode. In this case you sending multiple
commands to the server without waiting for replies.  You can use
I<send_command> and I<send_command_cb> methods to send multiple commands to the
server.  In case of I<send_command> I<reply_ready> method may be used to check
if some replies are already received, and I<get_reply> method may be used to
fetch received reply. In case of I<send_command_cb> redis will invoke specified
callback when it receive reply. Also if you not interested in reply you can
omit callback, then reply will be dropped. Note, that RedisDB checks for
replies only when you calling some of its methods, so the following loop will
never exit:

    my $reply;
    $redis->send_command_cb("PING", sub { $reply = $_[1] });
    sleep 1 while not $reply;

because redis will never receive reply and invoke callback.

Note also, that you can't use I<execute> method (or wrappers around it, like
I<get> or I<set>) while in pipeline mode, you must receive replies on all
pipelined commands first.

=cut

=head1 SUBSCRIPTIONS SUPPORT

RedisDB supports subscriptions to redis channels. In subscription mode you can
subscribe to some channels and receive all messages sent to these channels.
Every time RedisDB receives message for the channel it invokes callback
provided by user. User can specify different callbacks for different channels.
When in subscription mode you can subscribe to additional channels, or
unsubscribe from channels you subscribed to, but you can't use any other redis
commands like set, get, etc. Here's example of running in subscription mode:

    my $message_cb = sub {
        my ($redis, $channel, $pattern, $message) = @_;
        print "$channel: $message\n";
    };
    
    my $control_cb = sub {
        my ($redis, $channel, $pattern, $message) = @_;
        if ($channel eq 'control.quit') {
            $redis->unsubscribe;
            $redis->punsubscribe;
        }
        elsif ($channel eq 'control.subscribe') {
            $redis->subscribe($message);
        }
    };
    
    subscription_loop(
        subscribe => [ 'news',  ],
        psubscribe => [ 'control.*' => $control_cb ],
        default_callback => $message_cb,
    );

subscription_loop will subscribe you to news channel and control.* channels. It
will call specified callbacks every time new message received.  You can
subscribe to additional channels sending their names to control.subscribe
channel. You can unsubscribe from all channels by sending message to
control.quit channel. Every callback receives four arguments: RedisDB object,
channel for which message was received, pattern if you subscribed to this
channel using I<psubscribe> method, and message itself.

You can publish messages into channels using I<publish> method. This method
should be called when you in normal mode, and can't be used while you're in
subscription mode.

Following methods can be used in subscribtion mode:

=cut

=head2 $self->subscription_loop(%parameters)

Enter into subscription mode. Function subscribes you to specified channels,
waits for messages, and invokes callbacks for every received message. Function
returns after you unsubscribed from all channels. It accepts following parameters:

=over 4

=item default_callback

reference to the default callback. This callback is invoked for the message if you
didn't specify other callback for the channel this message comes from.

=item subscribe

array reference. Contains list of channels you want to subscribe. Channel name
may be optionally followed by reference to callback function for this channel.
E.g.:

    [ 'news', 'messages', 'errors' => \&error_cb, 'other' ]

channels "news", "messages", and "other" will use default callback, but for
"errors" channel error_cb function will be used.

=item psubscribe

same as subscribe, but you specify patterns for channels' names.

=back

All parameters are optional, but you must subscribe at least to one channel. Also
if default_callback is not specified, you have to explicitely specify callback
for every channel you're going to subscribe.

=head1 TRANSACTIONS SUPPORT

Transactions allow you execute a sequence of commands in a single step. In
order to start transaction you should use method I<multi>.  After you entered
transaction all commands you issue are queued, but not executed till you call
I<exec> method. Tipically these commands return string "QUEUED" as result, but
if there's an error in e.g. number of arguments they may croak. When you
calling exec all queued commands are executed and exec returns list of results
for every command in transaction. If any command failed exec will croak. If
instead of I<exec> you will call I<discard>, all scheduled commands will be
canceled.

You can set some keys as watched. If any whatched key will be changed by
another client before you call exec, transaction will be discarded and exec
will return false value.

=cut

=head2 $self->multi

Enter transaction. After this and till I<exec> or I<discard> will be called,
all commands will be queued but not executed.

=head2 $self->exec

Execute all queued commands and finish transaction. Returns list of results for
every command. May croak if some command failed.  Also unwatches all keys. If
some of the watched keys was changed by other client, transaction will be
canceled and I<exec> will return false.

=head1 WHY ANOTHER ONE

I was in need of a client for redis database. L<AnyEvent::Redis> didn't suite
me as it requires event loop, and it didn't fit into existing code. Problem
with L<Redis> is that it doesn't (at the time I write this) reconnect to the
server if connection was closed after timeout or as result or server restart,
and it doesn't support pipelining. After analizing what I need to change in
L<Redis> in order to get all I want (see TODO), I decided that it will be
simplier to write new module from scratch. This also solves the problem of
backward compatibility. Pedro Melo, maintainer of L<Redis> have plans to
implement some of these features too.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests via GitHub bug tracker at
L<http://github.com/trinitum/RedisDB/issues>.

Known bugs are:

Timeout support is OS dependent. If OS doesn't support SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO
options timeouts will not work.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Sanko Robinson and FunkyMonk for help with porting this module on Windows.
