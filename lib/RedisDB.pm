=head1 NAME

RedisDB - Perl extension to access redis database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RedisDB;

    my $redis = RedisDB->new(host => 'localhost', port => 6379);
    $redis->set($key, $value);
    my $value = $redis->get($key);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides interface to access redis key-value store. It
transparently handles disconnects and forks. It supports transactions,
pipelining, and subscription mode.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 $class->new(%options)

Creates the new RedisDB object. The following options are accepted:

=over 4

=item host

domain name of the host running redis server. Default: "localhost"

=item port

port to connect. Default: 6379

=item path

you can connect to redis using UNIX socket. In this case instead of
L</host> and L</port> you should specify I<path>.

=item password

Password, if redis server requires authentication. Alternatively you can use
I<auth> method after connection.

=item database

DB number to use. Specified database will be selected immediately after
connecting to the server. Database changes when you sending I<select> command
to the server. You can get current database using I<selected_database> method.
Default value is 0.

=item timeout

IO timeout. With this option set, if IO operation has taken more than specified
number of seconds, module will croak. Note, that some OSes do not support
SO_RCVTIMEO, and SO_SNDTIMEO socket options, in this case timeout will not
work.

=item utf8

Assume that all data on the server encoded in UTF-8. As result all strings will
be converted to UTF-8 before sending to server, and all results will be decoded
from UTF-8. See L</"UTF-8 SUPPORT">.

=item lazy

by default I<new> establishes connection to the server. If this parameter is
set, then connection will be established when you will send a command to the
server.

}

=head2 $self->execute($command, @arguments)

send a command to the server and return the result. It will throw the exception
if the server returns an error. It may be more convenient to use instead of
this method wrapper named after the corresponding redis command. E.g.:

    $redis->execute('set', key => 'value');
    # is the same as
    $redis->set(key => 'value');

See L</"WRAPPER METHODS"> section for the full list of defined aliases.

Note, that you can't use I<execute> if you have sent some commands using
I<send_command> method without callback argument and have not yet got all
replies.

send a command to the server. Returns true if the command was successfully
sent, or dies if an error occured. Note, that it does not return reply from
the server, you should retrieve it using the I<get_reply> method, or if I<callback>
has been specified, it will be invoked upon receiving the reply with two
arguments: the RedisDB object, and the reply from the server.  If the server
returns an error, the second argument to the callback will be a L<RedisDB::Error>
object, you can get description of the error using this object in string
context.  If you are not interested in reply, you can use RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY
constant as the last argument.

Note, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, so it will not receive
the reply and invoke the callback unless you call some of its methods which
check if there are replies from the server, like I<send_command>,
I<reply_ready>, I<get_reply>, or I<get_all_replies>.

=head2 $self->send_command_cb($command[, @arguments][, \&callback])

send a command to the server, invoke specified I<callback> on reply. The
callback is invoked with two arguments: the RedisDB object, and reply from the
server.  If the server returned an error, the second argument will be a
L<RedisDB::Error> object, you can get description of the error using this
object in string context.  If the I<callback> is not specified, the reply will
be discarded.  Note, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, so it
will not receive the reply and invoke the callback unless you call some of its
methods which check if there are replies from the server, like I<send_command>,
I<send_command_cb>, I<reply_ready>, I<get_reply>, or I<get_all_replies>.

B<DEPRECATED:> this method is deprecated and may be removed in some future
version. Please use I<send_command> method instead. If you are using
I<send_command_cb> with I<&callback> argument, you can just replace the method
with I<send_command> and it will do the same. If you are using
I<send_command_cb> with the default callback, you should add the
RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY constant as the last argument when replacing the method
with I<send_command>.  Here is the example that shows equivalents with
I<send_command>:

    $redis->send_command_cb("SET", "Key", "Value");
    # may be replaced with
    $redis->send_command("SET", "Key", "Value", RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY);

    $redis->send_command_cb("GET", "Key", \&process_reply);

=head1 WRAPPER METHODS

Instead of using I<execute> and I<send_command> methods directly, it may be
more convenient to use wrapper methods with names matching names of the redis
commands. These methods call I<execute> or I<send_command> depending on the
presence of the callback argument. If callback is specified, the method invokes
I<send_command> and returns as soon as the command has been sent to the server;
when the reply is received, it will be passed to the callback (see
L</"PIPELINING SUPPORT">). If there is no callback, the method invokes
I<execute>, waits for the reply from the server, and returns it. E.g.:

    $val = $redis->get($key);
    # equivalent to
    $val = $redis->execute("get", $key);

    $redis->get($key, sub { $val = $_[1] });
    # equivalent to
    $redis->send_command("get", $key, sub { $val = $_[1] });

The following wrapper methods are defined: append, auth, bgrewriteaof, bgsave,
blpop, brpop, brpoplpush, config_get, config_set, config_resetstat, dbsize,
debug_object, debug_segfault, decr, decrby, del, echo, exists, expire,
expireat, flushall, flushdb, get, getbit, getrange, getset, hdel, hexists,
hget, hgetall, hincrby, hkeys, hlen, hmget, hmset, hset, hsetnx, hvals, incr,
incrby, keys, lastsave, lindex, linsert, llen, lpop, lpush, lpushx, lrange,
lrem, lset, ltrim, mget, move, mset, msetnx, persist, ping, publish, quit,

=pod

The following commands implement some additional postprocessing of results:

=cut

=head2 $self->info

return information and statistics about the server. Redis-server returns
information in form of I<field:value>, the I<info> method parses result and
returns it as a hash reference.

=cut

sub info {
    my $self = shift;

    my $info = $self->execute('INFO');
    my %info = map { /^([^:]+):(.*)$/ } split /\r\n/, $info;
    return \%info;
}

=head2 $self->shutdown

Shuts the redis server down. Returns undef, as the server doesn't send the
answer.  Croaks in case of the error.

=cut

sub shutdown {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->send_command_cb('SHUTDOWN');
    return;
}

=head1 UTF-8 SUPPORT

The redis protocol is designed to work with the binary data, both keys and
values are encoded in the same way as sequences of octets.  By default this
module expects all data to be just strings of bytes. There is an option to
treat all data as UTF-8 strings. If you pass I<utf8> parameter to the
constructor, module will encode all strings to UTF-8 before sending them to
server, and will decode all strings received from server from UTF-8. This has
following repercussions you should be aware off: first, you can't store binary
data on server with this option on, it would be treated as a sequence of latin1
characters, and would be converted into a corresponding sequence of UTF-8 encoded
characters; second, if data returned by the server is not a valid UTF-8 encoded
string, the module will croak, and you will have to reinitialize the
connection. Generally, I would recommend to write a wrapper around L<RedisDB> instead of
setting I<utf8> option.

=cut

=head1 ERROR HANDLING

If an error happens which the module can't handle, it will croak. It may
happen as a result of a network error, or invalid data encoding, or if the
server returned an error reply. In some cases the RedisDB object after throwing
an exception will be left in inconsistant state. If you want to continue using
the object after getting an exception, you should invoke the
L</reset_connection> method on it. This will drop current connection and all
outstanding requests, so the object will return to the same state it was just
after creation with the L</new> method. If the connection was in subscription
mode, you will have to restore all the subscriptions, if it was in the middle
of transaction, you will have to start the transaction again.

=cut

=head1 HANDLING OF SERVER DISCONNECTS

Redis server may close a connection if it was idle for some time, also the
connection may be closed in case when redis-server was restarted. RedisDB
restores a connection to the server, but only if no data was lost as a result
of the disconnect. E.g. if the client was idle for some time and the redis
server closed the connection, it will be transparently restored on sending next
command. If you sent a command and the server has closed the connection without
sending a complete reply, the connection will not be restored and the module
will throw an exception. Also the module will throw an exception if the
connection was closed in the middle of a transaction or while you're in a
subscription loop.

=cut

=head1 PIPELINING SUPPORT

You can send commands in the pipelining mode. It means you are sending multiple
commands to the server without waiting for the replies.  This is implemented by
the I<send_command> method. Recommended way of using it is to pass a reference
to the callback function as the last argument.  When module receives reply from
the server, it will call this function with two arguments: reference to the
RedisDB object, and reply from the server. It is important to understand
though, that RedisDB does not run any background threads, neither it checks for
the replies by setting some timer, so e.g. in the following example callback
will never be invoked:

    my $pong;
    $redis->send_command( "ping", sub { $pong = $_[1] } );
    sleep 1 while not $pong;    # this will never return

Therefore you need perriodically trigger check for the replies. The check is
triggered when you call the following methods: I<send_command>, I<reply_ready>,
I<get_reply>, I<get_all_replies>.  Calling wrapper method, like
C<< $redis->get('key') >>, will also trigger check as internally wrapper methods
use methods listed above.

Also you can omit callback argument when invoke I<send_command>. In this case
you have to fetch reply later explicitly using I<get_reply> method. This is how
synchronous I<execute> is implemented, basically it is:

    sub execute {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->send_command(@_);
        return $self->get_reply;
    }

That is why it is not allowed to call I<execute> unless you have got replies to
all commands sent previously with I<send_command> without callback. Using
I<send_command> without callback is not recommended.

Sometimes you are not interested in replies sent by the server, e.g. SET
command usually just return 'OK', in this case you can pass to I<send_command>
callback which ignores its arguments, or use C<RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY> constant, it
is a no-op function:

    for (@keys) {
        # execute will not just send 'GET' command to the server,
        # but it will also receive response to the 'SET' command sent on
        # the previous loop iteration
        my $val = $redis->execute( "get", $_ );
        $redis->send_command( "set", $_, fun($val), RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY );
    }
    # and this will wait for the last reply
    $redis->mainloop;

or using L</"WRAPPER METHODS"> you can rewrite it as:

    for (@keys) {
        my $val = $redis->get($_);
        $redis->set( $_, fun($val), RedisDB::IGNORE_REPLY );
    }
    $redis->mainloop;

=head1 SUBSCRIPTIONS SUPPORT

RedisDB supports subscriptions to redis channels. In the subscription mode you
can subscribe to some channels and receive all the messages sent to these
channels.  Every time RedisDB receives a message for the channel it invokes a
callback provided by the user. User can specify different callbacks for the
different channels.  When in the subscription mode you can subscribe to
additional channels, or unsubscribe from the channels you subscribed to, but
you can't use any other redis commands like set, get, etc. Here is the example
of running in the subscription mode:

    my $message_cb = sub {
        my ($redis, $channel, $pattern, $message) = @_;
        print "$channel: $message\n";
    };
    
    my $control_cb = sub {
        my ($redis, $channel, $pattern, $message) = @_;
        if ($channel eq 'control.quit') {
            $redis->unsubscribe;
            $redis->punsubscribe;
        }
        elsif ($channel eq 'control.subscribe') {
            $redis->subscribe($message);
        }
    };
    
    subscription_loop(
        subscribe => [ 'news',  ],
        psubscribe => [ 'control.*' => $control_cb ],
        default_callback => $message_cb,
    );

subscription_loop will subscribe you to the news channel and control.*
channels. It will call specified callbacks every time a new message received.
You can subscribe to additional channels sending their names to the
control.subscribe channel. You can unsubscribe from all the channels by sending
a message to the control.quit channel. Every callback receives four arguments:
the RedisDB object, the channel for which the message was received, the pattern
if you subscribed to this channel using I<psubscribe> method, and the message
itself.

You can publish messages into the channels using the I<publish> method. This
method should be called when you in the normal mode, and can't be used while
you're in the subscription mode.

Following methods can be used in subscribtion mode:

=cut

=head2 $self->subscription_loop(%parameters)

Enter into the subscription mode. The method subscribes you to the specified
channels, waits for the messages, and invokes the appropriate callback for
every received message. The method returns after you unsubscribed from all the
channels. It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4

=item default_callback

reference to the default callback. This callback is invoked for a message if you
didn't specify other callback for the channel this message comes from.

=item subscribe

an array reference. Contains the list of channels you want to subscribe. A
channel name may be optionally followed by the reference to a callback function
for this channel.  E.g.:

    [ 'news', 'messages', 'errors' => \&error_cb, 'other' ]

channels "news", "messages", and "other" will use default callback, but for
the "errors" channel error_cb function will be used.

=item psubscribe

same as subscribe, but you specify patterns for channels' names.

=back

All parameters are optional, but you must subscribe at least to one channel. Also
if default_callback is not specified, you have to explicitely specify a callback
for every channel you are going to subscribe.

=head1 TRANSACTIONS SUPPORT

Transactions allow you to execute a sequence of commands in a single step. In
order to start a transaction you should use the I<multi> method.  After you
have entered a transaction all the commands you issue are queued, but not
executed till you call the I<exec> method. Tipically these commands return
string "QUEUED" as result, but if there is an error in e.g. number of
arguments, they may croak. When you call exec, all the queued commands will be
executed and exec will return a list of results for every command in the
transaction. If any command has failed, exec will croak. If instead of I<exec>
you call I<discard>, all scheduled commands will be canceled.

You can set some keys as watched. If any whatched key has been changed by
another client before you called exec, the transaction will be discarded and
exec will return false value.

=cut

=head2 $self->multi

Enter the transaction. After this and till I<exec> or I<discard> will be called,
all the commands will be queued but not executed.

    $self->{_in_multi} = 1;
    return $res;
}

=head2 $self->exec

Execute all queued commands and finish the transaction. Returns a list of
results for every command. Will croak if some command has failed.  Also
unwatches all the keys. If some of the watched keys has been changed by other
client, the transaction will be canceled and I<exec> will return false.

=cut

sub exec {
    my $self = shift;

    my $res = $self->execute('EXEC');
    $self->{_in_multi} = undef;
    return $res;
}

=head2 $self->discard

Discard all queued commands without executing them and unwatch all keys.

=cut

sub discard {
    my $self = shift;

    my $res = $self->execute('DISCARD');
    $self->{_in_multi} = undef;
    return $res;
}

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Redis>, L<Redis::hiredis>, L<AnyEvent::Redis>

=head1 WHY ANOTHER ONE

I was in need of the client for redis database. L<AnyEvent::Redis> didn't suite
me as it requires an event loop, and it didn't fit into the existing code. The
problem with L<Redis> is that it didn't (at the time I started this) reconnect
to the server if connection was closed after timeout or as result of the server
restart, and it does not support pipelining. After analizing what I need to
change in L<Redis> in order to get all I want, I decided that it will be
simplier to write the new module from scratch. This also solves the problem of
backward compatibility.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests via GitHub bug tracker at
L<http://github.com/trinitum/RedisDB/issues>.

Known bugs are:

Timeout support is OS dependent. If OS doesn't support SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO
options timeouts will not work.
